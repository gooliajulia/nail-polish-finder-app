###  **Project Overview**
**Purpose**: A tool to help users find nail polish color matches from a photo.

**Target Audience**: Anyone who is interested in nail polish.

**Platform**: Initially web-based, with plans for an iOS app.



###  **Features**
**Photo Upload**: Allow users to upload a photo of a nail polish, or any other photo with a color they'd like to find a nail polish match for

**Image Processing**: The app will accept the upload image, determine the HEX code of the dominant color, and try and find a match from our database.

**Matching Algorithm**: With the identified HEX code, the backend server will compare to real nail polish brand color matches from our database, and return the closest color match.

**Results Display**: Based on results from the backend server, the frontend appliation will display a number of best matches. Each match will include the brand name, color name, photo(s) of the nail polish, and a link to purchase the polish


**Additional Features**: Saving favorite results, Filtering by brand or color family, Sharing results externally via text, email, social media, etc.
     

###  **Architecture Overview**
   - **Frontend**:
     - Technologies: 
     - User interface layout and component structure (TBD)
   - **Backend**:
     - Technologies:
     - API design for communicating with the frontend
     - Integration with machine learning services for image analysis: (TBD)
   - **Database**:
     - Database design for storing brand and color data (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) - (TBD)
     - How user data and preferences will be stored.
   - **Image Processing**:
     - Explain the method for extracting dominant colors from photos. (TBD)
     - Identify any third-party APIs or custom ML models used for color matching. (TBD)

### **Technical Requirements** (Remove?)
   - **Frontend**: Frameworks, libraries, styling (e.g., CSS, Bootstrap, Material UI).
   - **Backend**: Language, framework, and API specification.
   - **Database**: Schema design and storage requirements.
   - **Image Processing**: Any libraries (OpenCV, PIL, etc.) or APIs (Google Cloud Vision, Clarifai) for color recognition.

###  **Deployment & DevOps**
   - **Hosting**: Where will the app be hosted (e.g., AWS, Heroku)? (TBD)
   - **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipeline. (TBD)
   - **Version Control**: GitHub for versioning and collaboration.
   - **Security Considerations**: User privacy, data storage, and security practices (e.g., HTTPS, encryption). (TBD)

###  **Scalability & Performance**
   - Handling large image uploads and processing them efficiently. (TBD)
   - How you plan to scale the backend (e.g., load balancing, caching). (TBD)

###  **Mobile App Roadmap**
   - Detail the plan to port the web app to iOS. (TBD)
   - Technologies for mobile (e.g., Swift or React Native). (TBD)
   - Features unique to mobile (camera integration for direct photo upload). (TBD)

###  **User Experience (UX) & Interface Design**
   - Outline wireframes or user flows. (TBD)
   - How users navigate from photo upload to results. (TBD)
   - Any user testing or feedback mechanisms. (TBD)

###  **Challenges and Considerations**
   - Potential technical challenges, such as accuracy in color matching. (TBD)
   - Legal and ethical considerations (e.g., using brand data, copyright for photos). (TBD)

###  **Future Enhancements**
   - Mobile app development. (TBD)
   - Adding features like AR for trying nail polish virtually. (TBD)
   - Expanding to more beauty products (e.g., lipstick, eyeshadow). (TBD)
